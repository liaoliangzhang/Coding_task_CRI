"aOf the 71 teams, 16 had independent tests and conclusions for stock and flow models leading to 87 team-level results. Of the 1,261 models submitted, 8 had convergence problems",,,,,
"bConclusion can be support, reject or not testable.",,,,,
"cCumulative explained variance. In the case of team-level subjective hypothesis conclusion, the outcome is multinomial therefore the 'variance explained' is technically residual deviance",,,,,
