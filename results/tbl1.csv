"aOf the 71 teams in the CRI,16 of them treated stock and flow measures as independent tests of the hypothesis. Therefore, there are 87 team-level observed tests, each with an independent subjective conclusion. Of these 87 team-level results there was an average of 17.69 test models per team [sd =18.77, min =1, max =112].",,,,,,,,,,,,
