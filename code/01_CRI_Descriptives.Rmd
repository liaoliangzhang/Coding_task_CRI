## Data

The datasets in here were worked up starting in the sub-folder [`team_code`](../team_code) in the  `team_code_R.Rmd` file and then in the project sub-folder [`data_prep`](../data_prep).

1. `cri.csv` = model-level data, numerical values
2. `cri_team.csv` = team-level data
3. `cri_str.csv` = model-level data, string values

```{r load, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE, include = FALSE}
cri <- read.csv(file = here::here("data/cri.csv"), header = TRUE)
cri_team <- read.csv(file = here::here("data/cri_team.csv"), header = TRUE)
cri_str <- read.csv(file = here::here("data/cri_str.csv"), header = TRUE)

# team stats
cri_count <- aggregate(cri_team, by = list(cri_team$u_teamid), FUN = "mean", na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Model Specification Codebook

A descriptives table is far too large to add, therefore we simply append some summary statistics to the codebook and place this in the Supplementary Materials Appendix II. Model Specification Coding and Distribution.

```{r codebook, include = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
codebook <- subset(cri_str, u_teamid != 0)
codebook$DV[grepl("Scale",codebook$DV)] <- "Scale"
codebook <- dplyr::select(codebook, DV, main_IV_type, main_IV_measurement, main_IV_time, num_countries, main_IV_as_control, software, mator, indepv, inv_weight) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(num_countries = factor(num_countries),
                  main_IV_as_control = factor(main_IV_as_control))

# Get weighted proportions
codebook1 <- tidyr::gather(codebook, "var", "value", DV:indepv) %>%
  dplyr::count(var, value, wt = inv_weight) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(var) %>%    
  dplyr::mutate(propw = prop.table(n)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() %>%
  dplyr::select(., propw)

# Get unweighted proportions plus n cases
codebook2 <- tidyr::gather(codebook, "var", "value", DV:indepv) %>%
  dplyr::count(var, value) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(var) %>%             
  dplyr::mutate(prop = prop.table(n)) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup()

codebook1 <- cbind(codebook2, codebook1)

percent <- function(x, digits = 2, format = "f", ...) {      # Create user-defined function
  paste0(formatC(x * 100, format = format, digits = digits, ...), "%")
}

# add a single row to each group
codebook1 <- codebook1 %>%
  split(.$var) %>% 
  map(~add_row(., var=unique(.$var), value=NA, n=1000, prop=NA, propw=NA)) %>%
  bind_rows()

codebook1$prop <- percent(codebook1$prop)
codebook1$propw <- percent(codebook1$propw)

# add a total row to each group
codebook1 <- codebook1 %>%
  split(.$var) %>% 
  map(~add_row(., var=unique(.$var), value=NA, n=0, prop="100.00%", propw="100.00%")) %>%
  bind_rows()

#reorder decreasing
codebook1 <- codebook1[order(codebook1$var, codebook1$n, decreasing = TRUE),]

# add labels
codebook1 <- codebook1 %>%
    mutate(value = ifelse(n == 1000, var, ifelse(n == 0, "total", value)))

codebook1 <- dplyr::select(codebook1, -var)

write.csv(codebook1, file = here::here("results/codebook1.csv"))
```

## Descriptives

### Sample 

Our final sample is `r length(unique(cri_str$u_teamid))` teams including `r sum(cri_count$team_size[cri_count$u_teamid != 0]) + 1` researchers that submitted `r length(cri_str$u_teamid[cri_str$u_teamid != 0]) + 1` models. Of those teams, one did not conduct the hypothesis test based on a failed measurement invariance test, another had all their `r length(cri_str$u_teamid[cri_str$u_teamid == 1])` models fail to converge and one other had one model out of several fail to converge. The result was `r length(unique(cri_str$u_teamid)) - 2` teams with numeric results of their hypothesis tests derived from `r length(cri_str$u_teamid[!is.na(cri_str$AME) & cri_str$u_teamid != 0])` models produced by `r sum(cri_count$team_size[cri_count$u_teamid != 0]) - 3` researchers in total with an average of `r round(sum(cri_str$team_size[cri_str$u_teamid != 0])/length(cri_str$id[cri_str$u_teamid != 0]),3)` researchers per team.
There were `r sum(cri_count$team_size)-2` participants in `r length(unique(cri$u_teamid))` teams that produced `r length(cri$u_teamid[cri$u_teamid > 0])` models, average of `r round(length(cri$u_teamid[cri$u_teamid > 0])/length(unique(cri$u_teamid)),3)` models per team.

There were `r sum(duplicated(cri_team$u_teamid))` teams that came to more than one conclusion. For example, finding support of the hypothesis for immigration stock models, but finding rejection of the hypothesis for immigration flow models. Therefore, we have `r length(cri_team$u_teamid)` observations ('results') in the team-level data that derive from `r length(unique(cri_team$u_teamid))-1` teams. We also have the conclusion from the study by Brady and Finnigan ([2014](https://doi.org/10.1177/000312240607100306)) that provides an example of a state of the art study for testing this hypothesis included as team number '0' for comparison purposes.

### Summary Stats

We no longer use this approach but leave these tables here in case of interest. The codebook is now our main summary statistics location.

Note that the N of 89 reflects the number of conclusions provided in total from 73 teams, with one of those conclusions having no results attached to it because the team concluded through measurement testing that the data were inappropriate. Thus, 88 is our team-level-results N for comparison.

## Main Findings - Tables 1-3

This chunk preps some of the stats for Tables 1-3, these tables will be completed in `05_CRI_Main_Analyses.Rmd`.

```{r Tbl1_3_data_prep}
# remove original study and non-conclusive results
cri0 <- subset(cri, u_teamid != 0)
cri_team0 <- subset(cri_team, u_teamid != 0 & u_teamid != 1)

tm_avg <- round(mean(cri_team0$inv_weight, na.rm=T),2)
tm_sd <- round(sd(cri_team0$inv_weight, na.rm=T),2)
tm_min <- min(cri_team0$inv_weight, na.rm=T)
tm_max <- max(cri_team0$inv_weight, na.rm=T)
```
